# Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model using linear regression to predict housing prices in the United States. By analyzing historical housing data and relevant features such as location, size, amenities, and economic indicators, we aim to build a predictive model that can estimate housing prices accurately.

# Dataset:
The dataset used in this project consists of historical housing data from various regions across the United States. It includes features such as:
- Avg. Area Income
- Avg. Area House
- Age	Avg. Area Number of Rooms	Avg. 
- Area Number of Bedrooms
- Area Population	Price	Address

# Methodology:
# Data Collection and Preprocessing:
- Collect the housing dataset from reliable sources such as government databases, real estate websites, or Kaggle.
- Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Perform feature engineering to extract relevant features and transform categorical variables into numerical representations if necessary.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Analyze the distribution of housing prices and explore relationships between features and target variable using visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
- Identify potential patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
  
# Feature Selection:

- Select the most relevant features that have a significant impact on housing prices.
- Use techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance from models, or domain knowledge to determine feature importance.
  
# Model Building:

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Implement linear regression model using libraries like scikit-learn.
- Train the model on the training data and tune hyperparameters if necessary.

# Model Evaluation:

- Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
- Compare the model's performance with baseline models or other regression techniques.
- 
# Model Deployment:

- Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for predicting housing prices.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for users to input property features and obtain predicted prices.
- Monitor the model's performance and update it periodically with new data if needed.

# Conclusion:
This project aims to demonstrate the application of linear regression for predicting housing prices using US housing data. By leveraging machine learning techniques and analyzing relevant features, we can provide valuable insights for homebuyers, sellers, and real estate investors. Additionally, the developed model can serve as a basis for further research and analysis in the field of real estate prediction.
